# new-request
Waiting for a mentor response is very tedious form e because i'm very excited. Since I request a review, i'm continiously refreshing the page (sometimes even quickier than the 30s automatized by Google). In order to reduce this exciment, I have created a python script that check the status of the activity at a given time, and will send you a Telegram message whenever it changes.
