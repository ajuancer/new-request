# Programming languages
The only used language is **Python**. I recommend using the lastest version. [This](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is the Official Downloads Page.

# Services
- Just your **Google Code-In account** and,
- a **Telegram account**. [Download](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.telegram.messenger) the app in your phone to get notifications.

# Programms
- **Google Chrome** browser. I recommend using the lastest version. The official chrome page is [this](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
- And **Selenium**, the browser automation toolkit. [Here](https://selenium.dev/downloads/) is the official downloads page, but you can download directly from the termianl by `pip install selenium`.

# Plugins and external python packages.
- The **Selenium Chrome Plugin**, that is the web driver. You can download [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/).
- And the python library `requests`, that can be installed through the python library with `pip install requests`.
